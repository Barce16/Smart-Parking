      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
<b>Parking management systems</b> play a crucial role in urban infrastructure by facilitating the efficient use of parking spaces, reducing traffic congestion.These systems leverage technology and data analytics to optimize parking space allocation, streamline operations, and provide real-time information to drivers. By implementing innovative solutions such as sensor-based monitoring, mobile applications, and digital payment systems, parking management systems aim to address the challenges associated with limited parking availability and urban congestion, ultimately contributing to more sustainable and livable cities.</p>
<br>
<p>However, traditional parking management systems are often plagued by various challenges that limit their effectiveness and impact on urban mobility. One of the primary problems is the inefficient utilization of parking spaces, with many areas experiencing underutilization or overcrowding. This leads to wasted space, increased circling time for drivers, and heightened frustration among motorists. Additionally, manual enforcement of parking regulations is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors, resulting in revenue losses for parking operators and inadequate enforcement of parking policies.</p>

<br>
<p>
Moreover, the lack of real-time visibility into parking availability exacerbates congestion and delays as drivers struggle to find parking spots efficiently. This inefficiency not only contributes to increased traffic congestion but also negatively impacts air quality and overall urban livability. Furthermore, the growing number of vehicles in urban areas further strains existing parking infrastructure, exacerbating these challenges and highlighting the need for innovative solutions to optimize parking management and improve urban mobility.</p>
<br>
<p>
In light of these challenges, there is a pressing need for advanced parking management systems that leverage technology to provide real-time parking information, optimize space utilization, streamline parking transactions, and enhance enforcement capabilities. By addressing these issues, parking management systems can play a vital role in creating more efficient, accessible, and sustainable urban environments for all residents and visitors.</p>
